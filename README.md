## 🌟 About The Project

**Agrovia** is transforming the way we think about food freshness and supply chain transparency. In a world where food waste costs billions and consumers demand to know where their food comes from, Agrovia bridges the gap between farm and table.

### The Problem We're Solving

- 🗑️ **1.3 billion tons** of food is wasted globally each year
- 📉 Consumers lack visibility into produce quality and origin
- 🏪 Retailers struggle with inventory management and spoilage
- 👨‍🌾 Farmers need better market access and fair pricing

### Our Solution

Agrovia provides an end-to-end tracking platform that:
- Monitors produce from harvest to shelf
- Uses AI to predict shelf life and optimal sell-by dates
- Empowers consumers with complete transparency via QR codes
- Helps retailers optimize inventory and reduce waste
